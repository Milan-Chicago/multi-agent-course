        "\n",
        "In Colang, the two most important concepts for building are *messages* and *flows*.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Messages\n",
        "In Colang, a conversation is modeled as an exchange of messages between a user and a bot. An exchanged message has an utterance, such as \"What can you do?\", and a canonical form, such as `ask about capabilities`. A canonical form is a paraphrase of the utterance to a standard, usually shorter, form.\n",
        "\n",
        "Using Colang, you can define the user and bot messages that are important for your LLM-based application. For example, an `express greeting` user message is defined as:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "define user express greeting\n",
        "  \"Hello\"\n",
        "  \"Hi\"\n",
        "  \"Wassup?\"\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "The `express greeting` represents the canonical form and \"Hello\", \"Hi\" and \"Wassup?\" represent example utterances. The role of the example utterances is to teach the bot the meaning of a defined canonical form. A canonical form is basically a paraphrase of the intent of a group of utterances.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Flows\n",
        "In Colang, flows represent patterns of interaction between the user and the bot. In their simplest form, they are sequences of user and bot messages. In the \"Hello World\" example, the greeting flow is defined as:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "define flow greeting\n",
        "  user express greeting\n",
        "  bot express greeting\n",
        "  bot ask how are you\n",
        "```\n",
        "This flow instructs the bot to respond with a greeting and ask how the user is feeling every time the user greets the bot.\n",

It acts as a filtration system by classifying content as safe or unsafe based on predefined categories, like violence, criminal planning, sexual content, or promotion of suicide & self-harm. Through the use of a taxonomy of harmful content categories, it ensures that AI-generated content adheres to ethical guidelines, preventing harmful or inappropriate material.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the following demo, we utilize a hosted serverless inference endpoint from [Runpod](https://www.runpod.io/) to run the [LlamaGuard model](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/LlamaGuard-7b). In order to follow along with this exercise, perform the below steps before you continue with the notebook:\n",

        "1. Register an account with Runpod.\n",

        "3. Input your Hugging Face model, which is \"meta-llama/LlamaGuard-7b\" for this exercise. Llama Guard is a private and gated model, so therefore you will also need to supply your HuggingFace token in the same dialog.\n",
        "4. Click \"Next\". You have the option of customizing your vLLM settings, which you might do if (for example) you were using a quantized model, but this is not required for our exercise.\n",
        "5. Choose your GPU.\n",
        "6. Click \"Deploy\".\n",
        "7. Copy the \"OpenAI Base URL\" value for the deployed endpoint. Return to this notebook and add a new secret RUNPOD_API_BASE to your Colab notebook Secrets tab with that copied value.\n",
        "8. Back on the Runpod endpoint page, click \"Create new API key\" next to your \"OpenAI Base URL\" value if it is shown. Copy the generated API key. Return to this notebook and add a new secret called RUNPOD_API_KEY with that value to your Colab Secrets tab."
